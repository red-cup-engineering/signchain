/**
 * contracts/phase - a contract's phase is its closure regime (Obsmetrologia
 * `Closure.Regime`). A phase states only its closure data: whether its closure
 * is Scott-continuous, whether its base is finite, whether its state space has
 * countable cofinality. `classify` reads the regime off that data, and every
 * other coordinate of the phase is read off the regime: when a settled value is
 * attained (finality), its completion cost (`regimeCost`), whether settling
 * needs evidenced coordination (`cohomologyVanishes`), and its energetic
 * behavior. Phase evidence is an observed closure ordinal, or a certificate. Its
 * regime is read off it and must be the phase's own.
 *
 * Observation reaches only the lower two rungs. A stage at which an approximant
 * equalled its successor witnesses strict. An orbit no observed stage settles
 * witnesses Scott, the directed join of its approximants, and only for a
 * Scott-continuous phase. The upper two rungs have a gap no iteration crosses
 * (`gap_iff_upper`), so an orbit that did not settle there is evidence of
 * nothing. Their evidence is a certificate naming the declaration that proves the
 * completion (`omega_ahead`, `residue_germ_ahead`), checked for its decidable
 * hypotheses by metrologic's `settling/certificate`.
 *
 * Contradiction is not a phase coordinate: the house is paraconsistent and a
 * cell holds both sides witnessed in every regime. Observability is the lens's,
 * not the phase's.
