/**
 * contracts/judgment — the computing stratum's semantic judgment as told evidence.
 *
 * The contract calculus reports outcomes as a polarity plus reasons; this module
 * tells that judgment as evidence (SignCell) and reads it with SignChain, so there
 * is one outcome algebra. The polarity states which sides are told:
 *
 * - witness       -> for            (for only) — the subject witnesses it
 * - obstruction   -> against        (against only) — the reasons witness against it
 * - partial       -> for and against (both sides)
 * - boundary-only -> neither        (no side) — interior evidence is not
 *   admissible through the phase's observability, so no evidence enters
