/**
 * SignChain — the evidence bilattice over SignCell's cells.
 *
 * A cell's evidence is a pair (F, A): the witnesses told for it and against
 * it. Its value is a point of FOUR (Belnap 1977; Ginsberg 1988), ordered two
 * ways — knowledge (how much is told) and truth (which way it leans) — with
 * negation swapping the sides. This is Obsmetrologia's Valued (Evidence.lean):
 *
 *   - every operation is lossless on evidence: joinK, meetK, joinT and meetT
 *     all union both sides, whatever they do to the value
 *     (evidence_accumulates_joinK and its mates);
 *   - the value is the four-point operation on the operands' values. The
 *     knowledge join of Measured tellings is Measured (joinK_measured); a meet
 *     can fall below what its witnesses show — "absurd reached, witnesses
 *     kept" (meetK_not_measured) — and the cell then writes its value;
 *   - negation swaps value and sides together and stays Measured
 *     (negate_measured); conflation moves the value alone; presumption raises a
 *     side no witness told without manufacturing a witness, the one
 *     sanctioned breach of Measured (presumeFree).
 *
 * The witness sets are ordered too (knowledgeLeq, truthLeq): inclusion of what
 * has been told, the order evidence grows in.
