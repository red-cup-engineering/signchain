/**
 * SignChain — the telling log: tellings in the order they were told.
 *
 * A telling is one row: a cell's triple, the side it tells (for or against),
 * and its witness — by default its position in the log, the way an EAVT row's
 * time witnesses its fact. Telling against is information about the same cell
 * (Belnap's "told false"), not the absence of telling for. The log only grows.
 * Read by pattern it gives back rows in order (so "the latest telling about
 * this" is well defined); read as cells it gives the cell set, each cell's
 * sides gathered from its rows. A cell set forgets order; the log keeps it.
